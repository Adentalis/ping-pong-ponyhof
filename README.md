# 🏓 ping pong ponyhof

At point this will be a tabletennis software for organizing tournaments. Based on the rules of the bavarian TT Race Tournament. See [here](https://www.bttv.de/) for more information.

Install all dependencies with `yarn` and start the electron app with `yarn start-dev`. This will start the electron app, serve the client app on `localhost:8000` and offers access to the backend on `localhost:4000` (which currently redirects to the client).
