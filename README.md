## Getting Started

### Starting Development
Install all dependencies with `yarn` and start the electron app with `yarn start-dev`. This will start the electron app, serve the client app on `localhost:8000` and offers access to the backend on `localhost:4000` (which currently redirects to the client).

### Starting Production
To start the app in `production` tip in `yarn start`. This executes the build process of the application and the client. After that electron will start.
